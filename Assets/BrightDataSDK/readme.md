# BrightData SDK integration guide

This package allows to integrate BrightData SDK into your apps.

## Documentation

Full integration guide is provided online - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uK0PE5NRqdF9V1S4I19xAmlFeoXTuFIQh3m5VvmiQWs/view#heading=h.5f0ba8e5hwx2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uK0PE5NRqdF9V1S4I19xAmlFeoXTuFIQh3m5VvmiQWs/view#heading=h.5f0ba8e5hwx2)

This document partially duplicates the online documentation.

## Prerequisites
- Xcode 13.4 or higher
- Unity 2020.2.5f1 or higher

## Structure of the source code

- `BrightDataSDK` - the main folder with SDK files;
- `BrightDataSDK/brdsdk.framework` - the compiled iOS framework for real
   devices (not working in iOS simulators);
- `BrightDataSDK/Sample` - the folder contains an example of how you can 
   integrate the SDK in your code;
- `BrightDataSDK/Sample/Scenes/` - the folder contains sample scene 
   `BrdsdkSampleScene` showing how you can integrate the SDK (it just shows 
   the correct flow on how the SDK is used in the code). 

## Sample Scene

You can use the sample scene to check on how the SDK works before integrating
it in your code.

- Open `BrdsdkSampleScene` from `BrightDataSDK/Sample/Scenes/.
- Make sure you will include the scene when Xcode project is generated
  on the next step.
- Generate Xcode project and run the app.
  Follow "Step 2.1.2. Generate Xcode project" section in
  ["iOS SDK Integration Guide for Unity"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uK0PE5NRqdF9V1S4I19xAmlFeoXTuFIQh3m5VvmiQWs/view)
  to generate Xcode project and run the app.

## SDK integration

1. Open `BrightDataSDK/Sample/SampleBehaviour.cs` and get familiar with the 
sample code. Add `BrdsdkBridge.init(..)` call into your code.
2. Open `BrightDataSDK/Sample/SettingsBehaviour.cs` and verify on how to use
other API methods in you Settings screen:
- `BrdsdkBridge.get_choice()`;
- `BrdsdkBridge.show_consent();`
- `BrdsdkBridge.opt_out();`
3. Implement your own Settings screen following the recommendations in 
["Step 2.4: Opt-out option"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uK0PE5NRqdF9V1S4I19xAmlFeoXTuFIQh3m5VvmiQWs/view#heading=h.hl9wma7gpjsy)
section.

### API methods

**`BrdsdkBridge.init(...)`**
Initializes the SDK.
Should be called at the app init. All other methods will be accessible after 
successful initialization.
```
BrdsdkBridge.init(
    string benefit_text, 
    string agree_btn, 
    string disagree_btn,
    ChoiceCallback on_choice_callback
)
```
- `benefit_txt` (string) the text which is used in the consent screen as 
a prefix: *"<benefit_txt>, allow Bright Data to use your device’s free resources 
and IP address to download…"*. If the parameter is not provided, then *"To
support <app_name>"* is used by default, i.g. *"To support My Sample App, allow
Bright Data to use your device’s free resources and IP address to download…"*

- `agree_btn` (string) - consent screen "agree" button text. 
Default value: "I Agree".

- `disagree_btn` (string) - consent screen "disagree" button text.
Default value: "I Disagree".

- `on_choice_callback` (function) - callback will be called every time a user
makes a choice or right after the `.init()` method is called. The parameter has 
the same meaning as the result of `BrdsdkBridge.get_choice()` (see it's
documentation for possible returned values).
 
**`BrdsdkBridge.show_consent()`**
Shows the consent screen on the user`s action. This can be used when a user
tries to close an ad or clicks the checkbox in Settings screen to activate 
Bright SDK.

**`BrdsdkBridge.opt_out()`** - disables Bright SDK.

**`BrdsdkBridge.get_choice()`** - returns the user`s choice status.
Possible cases:
- `BrdsdkBridge.CHOICE_AGREED (1)`  - SDK is enabled and works;
- `BrdsdkBridge.CHOICE_DISAGREED (2)` - SDK is disabled and disconnected;
- `BrdsdkBridge.CHOICE_NONE (0)` - before the user passes the consent screen for 
   the first time.

**`BrdsdkBridge.consent_shown()`** - Triggers post actions when consent screen
was shown. When you implement custom consent screen you must call this method
when the screen is presented. It returns True if no errors, false when sdk is
not initialized or this operation is not permitted.

**`BrdsdkBridge.get_uuid()`** - Returns current sdk uuid value. Nil in case sdk
is not initialized or stored uuid value.
